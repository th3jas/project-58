  <p>I love reading fantasy, anything that is fiction and very rarely non - fiction. I am 10 years old and study in 5th grade. After I finish my homework and are in break after watching some screen time, I default to reading books. I find books, fiction especilly, so fascinating because when you start reading a story it sucks you in and you cannot stop. It helps you become better at vocabulary as well aand that is why I love to read.</p>
